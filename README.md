I made purepoefully a very annoying game. 
A randomly generated sentence will pop on your computer screen and you will have to drag the realistic size hand over the realisticly sized watch.
Your goal is to write the sentence as quick and accurate as  possible (annoying I know) but dont worry! 
I used ngrams to program it so it will automatically choose the probabilisticly best letter to come after the letter you had just clicked down. 
For example, after w when you are in between m and n if you choose m by accident dont worry, it should be n!
This is just a little project for funsies
